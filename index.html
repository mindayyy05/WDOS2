                <p><br>Reptiles belonging to the family Testudines, turtles have bone shells covering their bony body. Turtles are in more than 350 different species.The shell of a turtle is composed of bone and cartilage. It has a top, known as the carapace, and a bottom, known as the plastron. Normally, the plastron and carapace connect at the sides of the body to form a hard skeletal box.More than 350 different species of turtles may be found on land, in both salt and fresh water, and on all continents of the world with the exception of Antarctica. South Asia and the southeast of North America are home to the most species.<br><br>
                    Turtles consume a variety of foods. Omnivorous turtles are common. Some turtles consume salps and jellyfish. The type of turtle known as a tortoise is mostly a herbivore, however certain species also eat insects and carrion. Other turtles eat the flora along the water. Some turtles even break through mollusc shells to get to the flesh.A turtle hatches in two stages: first, it leaves the egg, and then it comes out of the nest. Hatchlings shatter the inner surface of the eggshell with the aid of a sharp keratinous protrusion on the tip of their nose called a caruncle. They then rip a bigger hole and escape through it. Hatchlings burrow upward through the material covering the nest, frequently in groups, to exit it.</p>

            <p>There are numerous different species of turtles that call Sri Lanka home, and the country's coastline serves as an important breeding ground for them. Over the years, Sri Lanka's turtle population has encountered several difficulties, such as habitat loss, pollution, poaching, and unintentional catch in fishing nets. Through a variety of conservation initiatives and public awareness campaigns, efforts have been undertaken to protect and conserve these turtles.The government, local people, and conservation groups must work together to protect these lovely animals and guarantee the long-term survival of Sri Lanka's turtle stock.</p><br><br><br><br>
