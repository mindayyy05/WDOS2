                <p><br>The shallow seagrass meadows of the Indian Ocean, the vibrant coral reefs of the Coral Triangle, and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific are all home to seven distinct species of sea (or marine) turtles. Sea turtles spend the most of their life in the water, despite the fact that these highly migratory animals occasionally come ashore to either bask or breed. Five of those species—the green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley turtles—will be the subject of our attention.</p>

            <p>The green turtle is a kind of sea turtle that is a member of the family Cheloniidae and is referred to by its scientific name, Chelonia mydas. The average adult size of this type of turtle is 3 to 4 feet (1 to 1.2 meters) long and weighs 200 to 500 pounds (90 to 227 kilograms), making it one of the biggest turtle species.The green turtle, as its name indicates, is distinguished by a unique green coloring, notably on its shell and skin. The turtle's environment and age, however, might affect the color of the green. While adults often have a more yellowish-green tint, juvenile green turtles, also referred to as "black turtles," have a deeper coloring.<br>Coastal regions and coral reefs are where you may find green turtles in the world's tropical and subtropical waters. Due of their extensive migration, they can travel great distances between their feeding and breeding areas. During their yearly migrations, they have been known to cover thousands of kilometres.The way that green turtles nest is one of its most amazing characteristics. The same beaches where the females were born are where they deposit their eggs. Each clutch consists of 100 to 200 eggs, which are laid in deep sand nests. The hatchlings emerge after about two months of incubation and naturally swim toward the ocean.</p><br><br><br>

            <p>The word "hawksbill" refers to a bird's short, pointed beak. On their shells, they have a peculiar pattern of interlocking scales that give the edges a serrated appearance. Due to their unique colors and patterns, their shells are quite precious and frequently referred to as "tortoiseshell" in marketplaces.Hawksbills are primarily found in coral reefs in the tropical oceans of the world. They mostly eat sponges, which they pull from reef crevices using their tiny, pointed beaks, although they also consume sea anemones and jellyfish. The only surviving members of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are sea turtles. They are an essential component of marine ecosystems and support the survival of seagrass and coral reefs.<br>The hawksbill turtle's reproductive cycle is distinct. Females often return to their birth beaches to lay their eggs when they are between the ages of 20 and 30. They often lay between 100 and 150 eggs each nest, digging tunnels in the sand to do so. The females cover the nest and leave the eggs to hatch on their own after covering the nest during the nighttime nesting procedure. The hatchlings emerge and head for the water after an incubation period of around two months.</p><br><br><br>

            <p>The olive ridley turtle, Lepidochelys olivacea in scientific lingo, is a species of sea turtle renowned for its distinctive nesting habit and mass synchronized nesting occasions called arribadas. Being among the smallest sea turtles, it normally has a length of 2 to 2.5 feet (60 to 75 cm) and weighs an average of 75 to 100 pounds (34 to 45 kilograms).The olive ridley turtle is so named because of its heart-shaped, olive-green carapace, or shell, which is comparatively smooth in comparison to other sea turtle species. Their carapace can vary in hues of green, gray, and brown and is normally between 2 and 3 feet (60 and 90 cm) long. Typically, the plastron, or bottom of the shell<br>These turtles may be found across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans in tropical and subtropical seas. They are renowned for their extraordinary nesting habit, in which large numbers of females gather on particular beaches to conduct mass nesting occasions known as arribadas. Hundreds to thousands of turtles come ashore simultaneously to deposit their eggs during these arribadas. Although this occurrence is a fascinating sight, it also leaves the olive ridley turtle exposed to disruption from people and other dangers.</p><br><br><br>
